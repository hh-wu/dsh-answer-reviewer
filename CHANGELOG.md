# Changelog

All notable changes to `dsh-answer-reviewer` are documented here. The plugin
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); every release bumps
both `package.json#version` and this file in the same commit.

## 0.7.6 — 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **The config page moved from a dock above the composer to a first-class tab
  in the conversation view ring.** The plugin now registers into
  `conversation.view` — the `对话 / 轨迹 / 记忆系统` strip above the input — at
  `order: 40`, so the new tab lands last, after every shipped conversation
  view. The tab reads **Reviewer 配置** and the view area *is* the page: no
  collapse control, no overlay, no floating panel, nothing wedged above the
  composer.

  The host builds that strip from `slots.entries("conversation.view")`, where
  an entry without an `id` is skipped outright and the tab text is
  `resolveSlotLabel(options.label) ?? options.id` — so a `label` thunk plus a
  unique `id` is all a tab needs. The host renders a registered view only while
  it is the active tab (`renderSlot("conversation.view", props, { only: viewId })`),
  so switching away unmounts the subtree and the iframe's poll timers stop on
  their own. That is why the view component takes no `visible` prop and keeps no
  persisted open/closed state: **tab activation is the mount signal.**

### Removed

- The `conversation.input.dock` registration and its entire subsystem (~320
  lines): the collapsed one-line strip, the absolutely-positioned overlay, the
  `localStorage` open/closed memory (`readStoredOpen` / `storeOpen`), the
  `DockIcon` / `DockCaret` glyphs, and the `ConfigFrame({ fill: true })` overlay
  variant. `ConfigFrame` is now a single no-arg component shared by the view tab
  and the optional better-sidebar tab.

### Notes

- The dock existed only because `conversation.view` looked unusable by third
  parties at the time (0.6.0). It is in fact a documented `kind: "list"` child
  slot of `conversation.session`, and `id` is mandatory. Nothing else changed:
  the score chip, the optional sidebar tab, the `127.0.0.1:3987` HTTP server,
  the `ConfigStore`, and the whole review pipeline are untouched.
- Verified live on dsh `0.2.0-rc.1`: the strip reads
  `对话 轨迹 记忆系统 Reviewer 配置`, clicking the tab mounts the config iframe
  (1913×1011, `http://127.0.0.1:3987/`) with **zero console errors**, and the
  server-down hint stays hidden while the sidecar is up.
- Tests: the five dock tests were replaced by four view-tab tests — tab
  `id` / `order` / `label`, full-area fill with no `localStorage`, no collapse
  control or overlay, and both mounts embedding the same page. 58/58 pass.

## 0.7.5 — 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Host contract widened to DeepSeek Harness `0.2.0-rc.1`.** `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`
  and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session` now also accept `^0.2.0-rc.1`.

### Notes

- Metadata-only. dsh 0.2.0 added a **peer hard gate**: a bundle whose peer range
  does not cover the running host is skipped wholesale at boot, so the range had
  to be widened before the plugin would load at all on the new host.

## 0.7.4 — 2026-09-23

### Added
- `scripts.verify` (`check` + `test`) and a `prepublishOnly` hook, so the smoke
  suite gates every future publish. `check` walks all of `lib/*.js` with
  `node --check`, not just the entry point.
- `keywords`, `author`, and `engines.node >= 18` — bringing the manifest in line
  with the sibling `dsh-engineer-tools` package.

### Notes
- Metadata-only. `0.7.3` carried the substantive change (the 0.1.7 peer range);
  this release exists so the published manifest matches the repository.

## 0.7.3 — 2026-09-23

### Changed
- **Host contract widened to DeepSeek Harness 0.1.7-alpha.1.** `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`
  and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session` now also accept `^0.1.7-alpha.1`.

  This is a *tuple* change, which is the case the prerelease rule actually
  bites on. `^0.1.6-alpha.1` expands to `>=0.1.6-alpha.1 <0.2.0`, and
  `0.1.7-alpha.2` shares its `[major, minor, patch]` tuple with no comparator
  in that set — so `0.1.6 → 0.1.7` is **not** covered for free, unlike
  `0.1.6-alpha.1 → 0.1.6-alpha.2`. Verified with `semver.satisfies`:
  the old range FAILs against `0.1.7-alpha.2`; the new range passes.

  No source change was needed: this plugin does not import `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings`,
  so the 0.1.7 settings-API rework (`ctx.settings.register()` removed in favour of
  schema-derived forms) does not apply to it.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-09-15

### Changed
- **Host contract widened to DeepSeek Harness 0.1.6-alpha.1.** The two host
  packages this plugin imports at runtime — `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm` and
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session` — now accept `^0.1.6-alpha.1` alongside the
  previously supported lines.

  The range has to *name* the new line rather than widen to something like
  `>=0.1.5-rc.1`: npm evaluates the prerelease rule per comparator set, so a
  prerelease version only satisfies a set when some comparator in it shares the
  version's `[major, minor, patch]` tuple. `0.1.6-alpha.1` shares a tuple with
  none of the earlier comparators, so without an explicit `^0.1.6-alpha.1`
  alternative the plugin is reported incompatible with the current host.

- **No code change was needed for 0.1.6.** The one hook 0.1.6 removed,
  `agent/session-start`, was never used here; the plugin hooks `onTurnStopping`
  and the LLM seam only.

  `Session.snapshotEvents()` — read at `lib/index.js` — is deprecated as of
  0.1.6 (see the *deprecate-synchronous-session-event-reads* Agent Note), but
  the deprecation explicitly tolerates existing callers
  (*"Existing logic may remain unmigrated for now, but new calls are
  prohibited"*), and the read was already written as `typeof
  session.snapshotEvents === 'function'` with a `session.events` fallback, so it
  degrades to no-transcript rather than throwing if the method is ever dropped.
  Migrating to the async read path is tracked as a follow-up, not a 0.1.6
  requirement.

### Fixed
- **`@deepseek-ai/schemastery` is now declared.** `lib/review.js` imports it for
  the `z.object({...})` config schema that backs the live gate settings, but the
  specifier appeared in no dependency field. It resolved only because the host's
  module fallback symlinks every `@deepseek-ai/*` package it owns into each
  plugin's own `node_modules` — that is the host being generous, not a contract
  the plugin had subscribed to. The peer is now declared at `^3.18.1`, the same
  upstream line `dsh-builtin-browser` declares.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **The turn's final answer is now scored even when the retry cap is spent.**
  `onTurnStopping` used to `return` early once `maxChallenges` was reached,
  which skipped the review entirely. But a turn's final answer is the *only*
  one `conversation.chat.assistant-actions` binds to — the intermediate answers
  produced by steering are never the `closing.finalNode` the shell renders. So
  a turn that exhausted its retries ended with the answer the user actually
  reads being the one answer with no score, and the chip silently never
  appeared.

  The cap now suppresses **steering only**. A below-threshold answer at the cap
  is still reviewed and published, recorded with `decision: "capped"` so the
  tooltip can say *"未达标，重试次数已用尽"* instead of claiming a retry that
  never happened. The activity ring still logs `cap-exhausted`.

  Observed live: a turn that produced four answers (`024cdb59`, `80497c7c`,
  `9221c72e`, `ee8cf4e9`) recorded scores only for the first three, and the
  transcript — which shows only `ee8cf4e9` — showed no chip at all.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-11

### Added
- **The review score is now shown in the conversation.** Every finalized
  assistant message gets a score chip in its action row, beside the shipped
  copy/retry and Like/Dislike buttons: a tinted pill reading `评分 92`, with a
  state-coloured dot, and a tooltip carrying the gate, the verdict and the
  reviewer's own reason.

  The chip registers into `conversation.chat.assistant-actions` — the shell's
  `list` slot documented as *"Ordered actions for one finalized assistant
  message"*, `replaceRisk: "none"`, so it sits beside the shipped entries
  rather than shadowing them. Registration is
  `{ name, id: "answer-reviewer:score", order: 100 }`; the shipped feedback
  entry keeps the default order, so the score lands to its right.

  It renders **nothing** until a score exists for that exact message, so an
  install where the reviewer never runs (disabled plugin, no review route,
  unparseable reply, exhausted retry cap) looks byte-identical to stock dsh.

- **A same-origin score feed on the host webserver.**
  `GET /api/dsh-answer-reviewer/reviews` (`REVIEWS_ROUTE_PATH`) returns
  `{ entries, at }`, newest first. It is registered through
  `ctx.webServer.register({ kind: 'exact', path, handler })` — the same idiom
  `dsh-host-open-in-app` uses — so it lives on the page's own origin and is
  guarded by the composition's `connection.requestRejection` fence (Host and
  Origin check plus the login-token cookie). Registered through a lazy
  `ctx.inject(['webServer', 'connection'])`, so a non-web host loses only the
  chip and does not stall the plugin's activation.

  This deliberately avoids relaxing CORS on the `127.0.0.1:3987` sidecar: a
  page on the host origin cannot read a different port without an
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` the sidecar does not grant, and granting one
  would let any site the user visits read and rewrite their reviewer config.
  The sidecar still serves the same payload at `/api/reviews` for `curl`.

- **Scores are recorded per assistant message.** `ConfigStore.recordReview`
  keeps a message-id-keyed ring (200 entries) alongside the existing activity
  ring (50), because the UI looks a score up on scroll-back for every visible
  completed turn. `reviewsPayload` shapes the wire form and strips
  `sessionId`, which is diagnostics-only.

### Changed
- **`onTurnStopping` now also records the durable id of the answer it graded.**
  `latestAssistantMessageId(events, turn)` reads `assistant/message` →
  `data.message.id`, which is exactly the identity ui-chat hands to
  `conversation.chat.assistant-actions`
  (`messageId: close.finalNode.messageId`). Recording under that same key is
  what stops the displayed score and the gating score from drifting apart. The
  record also carries the threshold in force at review time, so a later
  threshold edit cannot retroactively recolour old chips, and the attempt
  number, so a retried turn can say `评分 61 · 第2次`.

### Notes
- Test count 53 → 59. New coverage: `latestAssistantMessageId` turn
  selection (including skipping interrupted and id-less messages), the
  message-keyed ring and its eviction, `reviewsPayload` shaping and trimming,
  `createReviewsHandler` (GET/405, the refusal short-circuit, an abstaining
  fence), the chip's label/band/tooltip and its deliberate silence, and an
  `onTurnStopping` integration test proving the score lands under the answer
  it graded — including that a retry's new answer id does not overwrite the
  failed one, and that an id-less answer is still gated but publishes nothing.
- The client bundle exposes `exports.__test` (`setScores`, `scoreBand`,
  `scoreLabel`, `scoreTooltip`). The score feed is module-private state with no
  cordis service to reach through, so the harness needs a seam.
- The chip's colours come from dsh's own `--dsw-alias-state-success-*` and
  `--dsw-alias-state-warn-*` tokens, so both themes resolve with no local
  palette.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **The dock is no longer crushed to a ~10px sliver.** `conversation.input.dock`
  entries are rendered as *direct flex children of dsh's fixed-height
  `.composerStack`*. With the default `flex-shrink: 1` the strip was squeezed
  until only a few pixels remained, and its own `overflow: hidden` then clipped
  the label — the row rendered as an unreadable broken sliver. The root now
  sets `flex: none`, exactly like dsh's own `QueueDock`.
- **The dock no longer stretches across the whole conversation column.** It now
  repeats dsh's own width formula
  (`width: calc(100% - 2*clearance - 2*inset)` +
  `max-width: calc(card-max - 2*inset)` + `margin: 0 auto calc(0 - gap - 3px)`),
  read off `QueueDock.module.css`, so it lines up with the composer card.

### Changed
- **Restyled to match dsh's native dock entries.** The strip is now a single
  32px button row (sliders glyph + 13px/500 label + rotating caret) on the
  native `--dsw-specific-tip` panel with a `12px 12px 0 0` radius and a
  `--dsw-alias-border-l1` hairline on three sides, so it reads as part of the
  composer's chrome instead of a floating widget. The previous bordered
  "展开" pill is gone.
- **Opening the dock no longer reflows the transcript.** The config panel is
  now an absolutely positioned overlay anchored at `bottom: 100%` of the strip
  (with `z-index: 30`, a 12px radius and a soft shadow) instead of an inline
  block. The old inline panel grew inside the fixed composer column, shoving
  the composer down and reflowing every message.
- **Smaller footprint when open.** The overlay is capped at
  `min(38vh, 340px)` (previously `min(56vh, 440px)`), and the collapsed strip
  hides the address and the `新标签` deep link, which now only appear while the
  panel is open.

### Notes
- Test count 51 → 53. The two new tests are regression guards for exactly the
  two defects above: `dock geometry cannot be crushed by the composer column`
  asserts `flex: none` plus the composer-aligned width/max-width, and
  `expanded dock overlays instead of reflowing the transcript` asserts there
  is exactly one absolutely positioned panel, anchored at `bottom: 100%` with
  a viewport-capped height, containing the iframe.
- The two dock tests now aggregate text with a `textOf()` helper instead of
  asserting on `button.children === '展开'`, because the whole strip is one
  button and the disclosure affordance is the caret rather than a text label.
  They assert `aria-expanded` and the open-only address/deep-link instead.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-11

### Added
- **A config dock on the conversation page.** The bundle now registers into
  the shell's `conversation.input.dock` slot: a collapsed strip above the
  composer that expands into the same config iframe the sidebar tab and the
  standalone server already use. Collapsed by default, and collapsing
  *unmounts* the iframe so a closed dock never runs the page's poll timers.
  The expanded/collapsed choice is remembered in `localStorage`.

  This is the **primary** mount because it needs nothing beyond the core
  `slots` client service, so it works on every install — the sidebar tab
  remains an optional add-on for people who prefer the sidebar, and the
  standalone `127.0.0.1:3987` page is unchanged.

  When the expanded dock cannot reach the config server (e.g.
  `REVIEWER_HTTP=0`) it swaps the frame for an actionable hint instead of
  leaving a blank box.

### Changed
- The sidebar tab and the dock now share one `ConfigFrame` helper, so both
  mounts embed byte-identical URLs and cannot drift apart.

### Fixed
- **`test/smoke.mjs` no longer hardcodes the managed Node runtime path.**
  It pinned the peer-resolution root at
  `.../node/versions/22.22.2-2/...`, which stopped existing when the
  WorkBuddy runtime was swapped to `22.22.2-3` on 2026-09-11 — the harness
  then failed to locate `cordis` / `dsh-llm` / `dsh-session` / `schemastery`
  and could not run at all. The root is now discovered from
  `versions/current`, a sweep of `versions/*`, the profile's `dsh-tools`
  symlink target, and finally the profile's own `node_modules`.

### Notes
- Registration uses `{ name, id, priority }`. Two non-obvious facts about
  the slot registry, both read off the shipped shell bundle:
  `kind: "list"` slots **throw** without `options.id`
  (`list slot "<name>" requires options.id`), and list ordering sorts by
  `(options.priority ?? 0)` first and `(options.order ?? 0)` only as a
  tie-break — so `priority` is the primary key and `order` is still a
  usable secondary one (dsh's own dock entries use `order: 0` / `order: 20`).
- `locale` is not validated by the registry and is deliberately omitted, so
  the dock adds no i18n surface; its few labels stay hardcoded Chinese.
- Test count 48 → 51. New coverage: both mounts registered through the lazy
  path, the dock descriptor shape (`id` / `priority`), collapsed mounts no
  iframe, expanded mounts exactly one, dock and tab embed the same URL, and
  the client's duplicated port literal stays in sync with
  `DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT`.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **A host without dsh-better-sidebar no longer shows a "Failed to load
  plugins" banner.** The client entry declared `exports.inject =
  ["betterSidebar"]`, a *hard* service dependency. `dsh-better-sidebar` is
  an optional add-on (the actual reviewing is host-side, and the config page
  is also served standalone on 127.0.0.1:3987), so on any host where its
  service was absent the entry stayed `pending (waiting for service:
  betterSidebar)` forever. The web boot audit reports every pending entry —
  `web boot: 1 entry did not activate` — and the shell renders that as a
  "Failed to load plugins" notice across the whole main page, blaming a
  plugin that was merely missing its optional companion.

  The tab is now registered lazily through `ctx.inject(["betterSidebar"],
  scope => ...)` — the same idiom the official client bundles use for
  late-arriving services. The entry activates unconditionally; when
  better-sidebar is present the tab appears exactly as before, and when it
  is absent nothing is registered and nothing breaks.

### Changed
- `package.json#dsh.client.inject` is now `[]` (was `["betterSidebar"]`).
  That field carries **package-row** names — every official bundle lists
  packages such as `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-conversation` — while
  `betterSidebar` is a Cordis *service*. The bundle needs no dynamic package
  rows at all: `react` / `react-dom` are static seed words in the shell's
  module table.

### Notes
- Test count 46 → 48. The old `inject=["betterSidebar"]` assertion is
  replaced by three: no hard inject, `apply()` reaches the lazy path and
  stays silent when the service never arrives, and `dsh.client.inject` lists
  no service name.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-09-09

### Added
- **The recent-activity list now refreshes itself.** The "最近 15 条审查
  活动" table polls `/api/recent` every 3 seconds and swaps only the table
  DOM — no more manual 「重新加载」 clicks, and unsaved config edits in the
  form above are never disturbed (a full `location.reload()` used to be
  required to see a new review). The poll fires immediately again when the
  tab/iframe regains visibility or the window refocuses, and a short fade
  animation highlights newly landed rows.
- The table is rendered client-side now; session ids are shown as the first
  8 chars of the uuid tail (e.g. `b6d12535`) instead of the ambiguous
  `session-` prefix.

### Notes
- Test count 45 → 46: a `GET /` page test asserting the poller, the client
  row renderer, and its local-time formatter are present.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Activity timestamps rendered 8 hours behind on GMT+8 hosts.** Times are
  stored in UTC (`new Date().toISOString()`), but the "最近 15 条审查活动"
  table sliced the raw ISO string (`slice(11, 19)`) and showed the UTC
  wall-clock. Introduced `fmtLocalTime()` — the table now renders the
  host's local timezone (`HH:MM:SS`), e.g. a `12:26:19Z` event shows as
  `20:26:19` in GMT+8.
- **Clean passes were misrecorded as `parse-fail`.** `parseScore` rejected
  any reply with an empty `reason`, but the review prompt explicitly lets
  the model leave `reason` empty when the score clears the threshold — so
  a pass on a good answer was classified as `parse-fail` (score `—`). The
  parser is now threshold-aware: an empty reason is accepted when
  `score >= threshold` (pass needs no feedback) and still fails closed
  below the gate, where concrete feedback is mandatory. `parseScore` keeps
  its strict contract when no threshold is passed.
- **`parse-fail` rows now carry a diagnostic snippet.** The recorded entry
  includes the first 120 chars of the unparseable reply, so future
  parse failures are debuggable from the activity table instead of being
  an opaque `—`.

### Notes
- Test count 41 → 45: empty-reason pass/reject/no-threshold cases, a local
  time formatting regression guard, and the "does not steer on pass" case
  now also asserts the activity is a real `pass` (it previously passed for
  the wrong reason — the reply was being rejected, not accepted).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Native right-sidebar tab in dsh-better-sidebar.** The config panel is
  now exposed as a host-native side card under the title "Reviewer
  配置" — click the sidebar's `+` menu, pick the entry, and the form
  mounts in the right column next to Files / Terminal / Browser.
- **`lib/client.js`** — new client bundle. Uses the standard
  `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })` contract. The
  component is a small header strip plus a flex iframe pointing at the
  same `http://127.0.0.1:3987/` endpoint the standalone server
  serves — no second source of truth, no React form logic. When the
  tab is not active the iframe unmounts (live views pause).
- **`dsh.client` declaration in `package.json`** — `inject: ['betterSidebar']`
  so the host guarantees `ctx.betterSidebar` is live when our `apply`
  runs.
- **Smoke coverage for the client bundle** — `vm.createContext` + a
  mini-React `createElement` mock exercises the full `apply` path:
  effect fires, `registerTab` is called with the expected descriptor,
  the rendered tree contains the iframe with the local server's URL,
  `exports.apply` and `exports.inject = ['betterSidebar']` are
  exposed. (2 new cases, 41 total.)

### Changed
- `package.json`:
  - `version` 0.4.0 → 0.5.0
  - new export `.`/`./client`
  - new `dsh.client` block alongside the existing `dsh.bundle`
  - `description` mentions the side card

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Live config via a self-hosted HTTP server on `http://127.0.0.1:3987`.**
  Tune the gate, switch the reviewer on/off, set the max-challenges cap,
  etc. from a browser form without restarting the host. The same JSON
  API is reachable from `curl` for automation.
- **ConfigStore (new `lib/config-store.js`)** — persistent, hot-reloadable
  config layer. Reads on startup, validates partials through the same
  `resolveConfig` path mount uses (no shape drift), persists overrides
  atomically to `~/.dsh/answer-reviewer.json` (or `REVIEWER_CONFIG_PATH`).
  Reset via `DELETE /api/config` removes the file so a missing file =
  defaults.
- **Review activity ring buffer (50 entries).** The config UI surfaces the
  last 15 review outcomes (pass / steer / parse-fail / cap-exhausted /
  no-text / no-route / review-error) so you can see what the gate did
  without grepping the host log.
- **HTTP routes**
  - `GET /` — HTML form + recent activity table
  - `GET /api/health` — `{ ok, at }`
  - `GET /api/config` — `{ config, overrides, source, path }`
  - `POST /api/config` — body: partial JSON; 200 on success, 400 on validation
  - `DELETE /api/config` — wipe overrides; file is removed
  - `GET /api/recent` — newest-first ring dump
- **Env vars** — `REVIEWER_HTTP=0` disables the server; `REVIEWER_HTTP_PORT`
  overrides the bind port; `REVIEWER_CONFIG_PATH` overrides the on-disk
  file path.

### Changed
- `onTurnStopping(ctx, store, counter, payload)` — the second arg is now a
  ConfigStore (was: a frozen Config). `store.get()` is the source of
  truth for the live config so a hot-reload between turns takes effect on
  the next turn with no restart.
- `lib/internal.js` is the new internal barrel so `lib/index.js` and tests
  both import from one place.

### Internal
- New files: `lib/config-store.js`, `lib/server.js`, `lib/internal.js`.
- Smoke test extended from 27 to 39 cases; the new ones cover load /
  update / reset / subscribe / activity / default-path / all 5 HTTP
  routes (including bad JSON and mismatched provider/model).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-07

### Breaking
- **`threshold` is the gate, `maxChallenges` is a leak guard.** Previously
  the plugin behaved as "ask the reviewer at most N times, let the turn
  close on any verdict". It is now "ask once per turn attempt; steer while
  the score is below `threshold`; stop steering after `maxChallenges` even
  if the score is still low". The defaults change too: `threshold` defaults
  to `80` and `maxChallenges` to `5` (was `3`). Migration: existing
  configs that set `maxChallenges: 3` continue to work — the cap is still
  enforced, just no longer conflated with the verdict.

### Added
- `extractUserPrompts(session, turn)` — walks the session's `user/message`
  events and concatenates every one whose `source.kind` is not `'plugin'`.
  Plugin-injected context (file-change notices, AGENTS.md, skill content,
  system reminders) is dropped so the reviewer scores against what the
  user actually asked. The result is tagged `<all_user_prompts>` in
  `buildReviewPrompt`.
- `parseScore(raw)` (replaces `parseVerdict`) — reads
  `{ "score": <int 1..100>, "reason": <string> }`. Returns a frozen
  `{ score, reason }` object. **Out-of-band scores are REJECTED, not
  clamped**: a reviewer that returns `-1`, `9999`, `"1.5"`, or
  `"ninety-eight"` is treated as a parse failure, not a free pass.
- `isScoreAcceptable(score, threshold)` — the inclusive gate predicate.
- `buildReviewPrompt` now embeds `<all_user_prompts>` and an explicit
  "user constraints trump completeness" rule (see below).
- `CONFIGURE.md` — detailed configuration guide covering the
  default-vs-independent model question, threshold tuning, and the
  fail-closed/fail-open matrix.

### Changed
- `parseVerdict` → `parseScore`. **The reviewer prompt asks for an
  integer 1-100 plus a single reason, not a `verdict/reasons` pair.**
  Hosts pinned to a review model that cannot follow JSON-only output
  should set `maxReviewTokens` higher (and pre-test the reviewer prompt
  with a smoke run).
- `buildSteerMessage` takes `{score, reason, attempt, maxAttempts}` and
  phrases the re-injection around "scored X/100, below the gate", so
  the agent knows the score is the gate it failed, not a vague failure.
- `resolveConfig` rejects out-of-range `threshold` values and falls
  back to the default. A mis-set config no longer quietly moves the gate
  from 80 to 100 behind the user's back.
- `maxChallenges` is hard-capped at `8` (was implicit-unbounded). Past
  that the config value silently falls back to the cap, not the default.

### Fixed
- **Reviewer no longer punishes explicitly-brief answers.** Without the
  fix, asking the agent for a short reply (e.g. "只回复OK两个字") led to
  the reviewer scoring 40 ("reply is too thin") and steering the agent
  into more prose. The prompt now states, as a CRITICAL rule, that
  "satisfying an explicit user constraint IS the requirement" with a
  worked example. End-to-end: "只回复OK两个字符" now scores ≥ 80 and
  closes in one step (was 6 steps / 5 steers).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-03

### Added
- Subagent filtering: turns whose session header has `origin === 'subagent'`
  are skipped. Subagent output is intermediate, not user-facing.
- Abort-signal short-circuit: if the user pauses or cancels the turn, the
  review call is cancelled mid-flight and the turn is left alone.
- `createChallengeCounter` — per-(session, turn) counter that drives the
  `maxChallenges` cap. Frozen `{ get, bump, reset }` API.
- Smoke harness (`test/smoke.mjs`) covering parse, prompt, steer message,
  counter, and the fail-open/skip-subagent/cap-exhausted branches.
- `apply()` declares `inject: ['llm']` so the cordis loader guarantees
  `ctx.llm` is mounted before the review listener attaches.

### Changed
- `apply()` routes all diagnostics through `ctx.logger` instead of
  `console.log`/`console.error`, so the host's logging policy (level,
  redaction, sink) governs plugin output. Stderr stays clean.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-01

### Added
- Initial release.
- `lib/review.js`: `resolveConfig`, `extractAssistantText`, `buildReviewPrompt`,
  `parseVerdict`, `buildSteerMessage`, `createChallengeCounter`, public
  `Config` zod schema.
- `lib/index.js`: cordis `apply()` with `agent/turn-stopping` listener,
  LLM route resolver (`ctx.llm.stream` with `reviewProvider`/`reviewModel`
  fallback), `BlockAssembler`-shaped stream-to-text collection with
  abort-signal short-circuit and deadline, and `agent.steer(...)` injection.
- `cordis.patch.yml`: bundle entry.
- `README.md`: install, config, behaviour.

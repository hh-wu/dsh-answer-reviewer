# dsh-answer-reviewer

A dsh host plugin: every time the agent is about to close a turn, the
plugin extracts the assistant's final user-facing text and asks a dedicated
review model to grade it on a 1-100 scale. If the score is below the
configured `threshold` (default `80`), the plugin steers the agent back
into the same turn with the reviewer's single most important finding as
concrete feedback. Once a turn has been steered `maxChallenges` times
(default `5`), the agent's reply is allowed to close the turn as-is — the
cap is a leak guard, not the real gate; the score threshold is.

Tune the gate, switch the reviewer on/off, change the max-challenges cap,
or pick a dedicated review model — all live, no host restart — from the
**Reviewer 配置 tab** in the conversation view ring above the composer,
from the optional sidebar tab, from the self-hosted config UI on
**`http://127.0.0.1:3987`**, or via the same JSON API from `curl`. Every reviewed answer then shows its own
**score chip** in the message action row (see
[Score chip](#score-chip-since-070)). The on-disk config lives at
`~/.dsh/answer-reviewer.json` (override with `REVIEWER_CONFIG_PATH`);
turns of the host go through with the defaults if the file is absent.

The review model sees **every real user prompt** the user has issued in
the session (any `user/message` event whose `source.kind` is `'user'`,
the host's marker for typed input), tagged `<all_user_prompts>`, plus
the assistant's final
reply under `<reply>`. Plugin-injected context (file-change notices,
AGENTS.md, skill content, system reminders) is filtered out so the
reviewer scores against what the user actually asked, not against the
context the harness happened to be carrying.

The review model is independent from the agent's working model when
`reviewProvider` / `reviewModel` are configured; otherwise the plugin
falls back to the agent's current route so it works out of the box.

The score is not just an internal gate — it is **shown on the answer it
graded**:

```
  ⤷  ⧉  ↻  👍  👎   ● 评分 92        ← in the message's action row
```

## Score chip (since 0.7.0)

Every finalized assistant message carries the score the reviewer gave it,
as a small tinted chip in the message's action row, next to the shipped
copy/retry and Like/Dislike buttons:

| Verdict | Chip | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cleared the gate | `● 评分 92` on a green tint | `score >= threshold`; the turn closed on the first look |
| Below the gate | `● 评分 61 · 第2次` on an amber tint | Steered back for a retry; the number in the chip is the attempt that finally counted |
| Out of retries | `● 评分 55 · 第4次` on an amber tint | Still below the gate and `maxChallenges` was spent, so nothing was pushed back (since 0.7.1) |

Hover the chip for the gate, the verdict and the reviewer's own reason:

```
阈值 80 · 通过 · 第 4 轮
The reply answered the question but never named the failing file.
```

Design notes:

- **It binds to the answer, not to the turn.** The score is recorded under
  the same durable message id the shell hands to the action row
  (`assistant/message` → `data.message.id`), so the chip and the gate can
  never disagree about which answer a score belongs to.
- **It renders nothing when there is no score.** Disabled plugin, no review
  route, an unparseable reply, or an exhausted retry cap all leave the row
  byte-identical to stock dsh — no placeholder, no spinner, no reserved space.
- **Retries are visible.** A turn that was steered shows `第2次` on the answer
  that finally passed, so a passing score on a third attempt does not read
  like a first-try pass. A failed intermediate answer keeps its own chip if
  it has one.
- **The last answer always carries a chip.** The retry cap silences *steering*,
  never the review — a turn whose `maxChallenges` ran out still publishes its
  final score, marked `capped`. Anything else would make the answer the user
  actually reads the one answer with no score (fixed in 0.7.1).
- **Colours are the host's.** The chip uses dsh's own
  `--dsw-alias-state-success-*` / `--dsw-alias-state-warn-*` tokens, so it
  follows the active theme with no local palette.

### The score feed

The chip reads a same-origin JSON feed the host mounts on its own webserver:

```
GET /api/dsh-answer-reviewer/reviews   →   { entries: [...], at }
```

Each entry is `{ messageId, score, threshold, decision, attempt, turn, reason, at }`,
newest first, capped at the 200 most recent scores. It is registered through
the host's `ctx.webServer.register(...)` and gated by the composition's
connection fence (Host/Origin check plus the login-token cookie), which is
why the page can read it without any CORS relaxation. The `127.0.0.1:3987`
sidecar deliberately does **not** grant cross-origin reads — doing so would
let any site the user visits read and rewrite their reviewer config — but it
does mirror the same payload at `/api/reviews` for `curl`.

## Why a separate model?

The review model uses a strict JSON-only grader prompt (`{score, reason}`)
that the agent never sees directly. The findings are injected back as a
`user/message` with the producer-owned source
`{ kind: 'dsh-answer-reviewer', note: 'steer-<n>/<cap>' }`, so the agent
treats them as user input — but
the agent is explicitly told not to mention the review to the user. A
different provider/model reduces the chance that a self-graded check
rubber-stamps its own work, and the explicit numerical gate means a
well-tuned model that returns 80+ will not trigger any re-attempt.

## Live config (since 0.4.0)

The plugin starts a tiny `node:http` server bound to `127.0.0.1:3987`
(no external access). Open it in a browser to see the form, the on-disk
config path, and a rolling list of the last 15 review outcomes. The same
JSON API is reachable from the shell:

```bash
# Read current effective config + overrides + file path
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3987/api/config

# Tweak the threshold (only the fields you POST are written)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3987/api/config \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"threshold": 90}'

# Disable the reviewer
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3987/api/config \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'

# Wipe overrides back to defaults (also removes the on-disk file)
curl -s -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:3987/api/config

# See the last 20 review outcomes
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3987/api/recent

# See the score of every recent assistant answer, by message id
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3987/api/reviews
```

Disable the server with `REVIEWER_HTTP=0`. Change the port with
`REVIEWER_HTTP_PORT=<n>`. Move the on-disk file with
`REVIEWER_CONFIG_PATH=<abs path>`. The next turn picks up the new value
with no host restart.

## Config tab (since 0.7.6)

The plugin registers a first-class tab into the shell's `conversation.view`
slot — the same ring that carries dsh's own `对话 / 轨迹 / 记忆系统` tabs above
the composer:

```
  对话 │ 轨迹 │ 记忆系统 │ Reviewer 配置
                          ╰──────────── active → the main area is the page
```

Click the tab and the config page takes over the conversation area, exactly
like any other conversation view:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  dsh-answer-reviewer · 实时配置   新标签打开  127.0.0.1:3987 │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                        │
│              (the config form, iframed)                │
│                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Three deliberate design points:

- **It is a real view, not a strip above the composer.** The tab is registered
  with `order: 40`, so it lands after every shipped view (chat `0`,
  trajectory `10`, mnemon `30`). dsh renders a registered view only while it is
  the *active* tab, so switching away unmounts the iframe and its poll timers
  stop on their own — no `visible` prop, no persisted open/closed state.
- **No collapse control and no overlay.** A tab has no "open" and "closed"; the
  view area *is* the page. That removes the old dock's whole geometry problem
  (overlaying rather than pushing the fixed-height composer column) at the
  source.
- **A dead config server gets a hint, not a blank frame.** The view probes
  `/api/health` once on mount; if the sidecar is down (e.g. `REVIEWER_HTTP=0`)
  it replaces the frame with an actionable message pointing at the port and the
  host log.

This is the **primary** surface: it needs nothing beyond the core `slots`
client service, so it is available on every install — no `dsh-better-sidebar`
required.

The tab, the sidebar tab, and the standalone page all embed the **same**
URL. Saving through any of them is observable to the others on the very
next GET, because all three read the one `ConfigStore` living in the host
process.

## Side card (since 0.5.0)

If the host profile also installs
[`dsh-better-sidebar`](https://dshfind.com/en/plugins/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar),
the plugin also registers a right-sidebar tab titled **"Reviewer 配置"**.
Open it from the sidebar's `+` menu (next to Files / Terminal / Browser).
The tab content is the same form as the standalone server, loaded
inside an iframe — saving a value through the tab is observable to the
standalone server (and vice versa) on the very next GET. When the tab
is not active the iframe unmounts so background tabs do not keep
polling.

If `dsh-better-sidebar` is not installed, the side card is simply hidden —
the config tab and the standalone `127.0.0.1:3987` page still cover
you. Every surface is optional and the plugin works with none of them.

The better-sidebar dependency is **soft, by design**: the tab is waited for
lazily (`ctx.inject(["betterSidebar"], …)`) rather than declared in
`exports.inject`. A hard inject would leave the client entry
`pending (waiting for service: betterSidebar)` on any host without
dsh-better-sidebar, which the web boot audit reports as
`web boot: 1 entry did not activate` and the shell renders as a
**"Failed to load plugins"** banner over the whole main page. See the 0.5.3
changelog entry.

## Install

Add the package to your profile's `dependencies` and to
`dsh.profile.bundles`, then refresh the host.

```jsonc
// ~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dsh-answer-reviewer": "file:/Users/bycall/Downloads/workbuddy/Claw/dsh-answer-reviewer"
  },
  "dsh": {
    "profile": {
      "bundles": [
        "dsh-answer-reviewer"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then `dsh plugin --profile web install` and restart the host.

## Configuration

| key               | type      | default | meaning                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`         | `boolean` | `true`  | Kill switch. Set to `false` to disable without uninstalling.     |
| `threshold`       | `number`  | `80`    | Inclusive 1-100 score gate. Below this, the plugin steers.       |
| `maxChallenges`   | `number`  | `5`     | Hard cap on steers per (session, turn). Hard-capped at `8`.      |
| `maxReviewTokens` | `number`  | `512`   | Output cap for the review model.                                 |
| `timeoutMs`       | `number`  | `60000` | Wall-clock cap on the review call.                               |
| `reviewProvider`  | `string`  | agent's | Provider for the dedicated review model. Must pair with model.   |
| `reviewModel`     | `string`  | agent's | Model id for the dedicated review model. Must pair with provider. |

`threshold` must be an integer in `[1, 100]`; out-of-range values fall
back to the default rather than being silently clamped (so a mis-set
config does not quietly change the gate from "80" to "100").

`reviewProvider` and `reviewModel` must be supplied together; supplying
one without the other is a configuration error and the plugin will
refuse to mount.

## Behaviour

- **Subagent turns are skipped.** The plugin only reviews the user-facing
  agent. `agent.session.header.origin === 'subagent'` is filtered out.
- **Empty / interrupted assistant output is skipped.** No review means no
  steer.
- **Review call failures are fail-open.** Network errors, timeouts, parse
  failures, or model-side errors all log a warning and let the turn close
  normally. A flaky reviewer must never wedge the host.
- **Aborted signals short-circuit.** If the user paused or cancelled the
  turn, the review is cancelled mid-flight and the turn is left alone.
- **Out-of-band scores fail closed.** The review model must return an
  integer in `[1, 100]` with a non-empty `reason`. Anything else (model
  returns "1.5", "99.9%", "I score this ...", etc.) is treated as a
  parse failure — failing open would let a misbehaving reviewer buy a
  pass by returning garbage.
- **Per-turn counter is capped.** Once a turn has been steered
  `maxChallenges` times, subsequent turn boundaries inside the same turn
  are allowed to close without review. With the default `5` you will
  see at most five steered re-attempts before the agent's reply goes to
  the user as-is, even if the review model still scores it below the
  threshold — the cap is a hard budget, not a soft hint.
- **The agent is told not to mention the review.** The steer message
  explicitly instructs the agent to address the finding silently.

## Test

```
node test/smoke.mjs
```

The smoke test exercises every pure helper plus the fail-open,
skip-subagent, below-threshold, and cap-exhausted branches of
`onTurnStopping` with mock objects (mocked `BlockAssembler`-shaped stream
chunks). It does not boot a dsh host.

## Files

- `lib/index.js` — cordis `apply`, wires the listener and orchestrates the
  review call. Imports from `./internal.js`.
- `lib/internal.js` — barrel re-export so `lib/index.js` and tests import
  from one place.
- `lib/review.js` — pure helpers: `resolveConfig`, `extractAssistantText`,
  `extractUserPrompts`, `buildReviewPrompt`, `parseScore`,
  `isScoreAcceptable`, `buildSteerMessage`, `createChallengeCounter`,
  and the public `Config` zod schema.
- `lib/config-store.js` — `createConfigStore` (persistent, hot-reloadable),
  `defaultConfigPath`, env-var constants for the HTTP server.
- `lib/server.js` — `startServer(store, opts)` — the 127.0.0.1-only
  `node:http` instance (HTML form + JSON API).
- `lib/client.js` — `window.__ModuleLoader__.load` client bundle. Registers
  the score chip and the `Reviewer 配置` tab into the shell's
  `conversation.chat.assistant-actions` / `conversation.view` slots; when the
  host profile also includes `dsh-better-sidebar`, registers a
  "Reviewer 配置" side card too. Both mounts are optional and the entry
  activates with neither.
- `cordis.patch.yml` — cordis bundle entry that mounts the plugin.
- `test/smoke.mjs` — node ESM smoke test (58 cases).
- `CONFIGURE.md` — detailed configuration guide (default vs independent
  review model, threshold tuning, fail-closed/fail-open matrix).
- `CHANGELOG.md` — versioned release history.

## Further reading

- **`CONFIGURE.md`** — answers "how do I configure an independent
  reviewer model", "how should I pick a threshold", and "what does this
  plugin do on bad config". Read it before tuning `threshold` or wiring
  up a second provider.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — the breaking change in `0.3.0` is the
  threshold/maxChallenges split; if you are upgrading from `0.2.x`, read
  the migration note there.
